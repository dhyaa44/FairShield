FairShield is a reputation-based sybil risk engine designed to protect token distributions and onchain grant programs from capital farming.

By transforming FairScore into dynamic risk tiers, FairShield adjusts allocation weight, vesting schedules, and claim timing based on participant credibility.

This approach enables projects to reward genuine contributors more efficiently while reducing sybil capture without relying on intrusive identity systems, FairShield turns onchain reputation into a programmable capital protection layer for fair and scalable distribution.
